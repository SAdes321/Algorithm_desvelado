This is a tutorial for sample strategy which will help the interns get a good understanding of the basic structure of algorithmic trading strategies developed at Mudraksh and McShaw.

Currently we use python for backtesting and deployment of algorithmic strategies and thus proficiency in python is a must.

Also download Visual Studio Code and MongoDb Compass on your system

Before starting this tutorial, it is strongly recommended that an intern has a basic understanding of the following libraries and concepts in python-

1. Object oriented programming
2. NoSQL Database (Understand MongoDB as we are currently using the same)
3. Version control, git, GitHub
4. Logging in python
5. Pandas
6. Numpy
7. Pymongo
8. Tcp/IP
9. Multiprocessing
10. Exception Handling


Also as algorithmic trading a multi disciplinary field, interns are expected to have a basic understanding of financial markets as well.
